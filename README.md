# Web Application Testing Sprint 3

## Overview
In this sprint, we will focus on testing web applications. You will learn how web applications function, including the client-server architecture, front-end, back-end, URL, and HTTP. You will also learn how to test UI elements, cross-browser, and cross-platform compatibility, and responsive design. Tools such as Figma, DevTools, and Requestly will be used to enhance your testing process.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of Sprint 3, you will be able to:

- Understand how web applications work (client-server architecture, URLs, HTTP).
- Test user interface (UI) elements.
- Perform cross-platform and cross-browser testing.
- Test responsive web designs.
- Use Figma and DevTools for UI testing.
- Create test cases using test design techniques like equivalence classes, boundary values, and decision tables.

## Chapters Overview

### Chapter 1: How a Web Application Works
- Introduction to web applications
- HTTP requests and responses
